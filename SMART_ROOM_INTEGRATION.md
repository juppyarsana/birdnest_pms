### **Smart Room Configuration** (`/iot/smart/{room}/config/`)
- **Aligned with control page** - matching all control sections
- **Device connection settings**
- **Endpoint configuration** for all features
- **Test functionality** for each endpoint
- **Save/load configuration** with status indicators

## ðŸ”„ LEGACY SYSTEM (Backup)

### **Legacy Access** (`/iot/legacy/`)
- **Basic interface** - kept for compatibility
- **Simple room number input**
- **Fallback option** if needed

### **Legacy Control** (`/iot/room/{room}/`)
- **Old tablet interface** - still functional
- **Basic controls** - original implementation
- **ESP32 configuration** - original config page

## ðŸ“‹ CURRENT STATUS

### **Phase 1: COMPLETED âœ…**
- [x] Smart system is now the **default interface**
- [x] Main `/iot/` URL redirects to smart room access
- [x] Legacy system available at `/iot/legacy/` as backup
- [x] All smart system features fully integrated
- [x] Dark elegant theme consistent throughout

### **Phase 2: RECOMMENDED (Future)**
After confirming smart system works perfectly in production:

#### **Safe to Remove:**
- `room_access.html` (replaced by `smart_room_access.html`)
- `room_control.html` (replaced by `smart_room_control.html`) 
- `esp32_configuration.html` (replaced by `smart_room_config.html`)
- Legacy URL patterns and view functions
- Legacy CSS and JavaScript

#### **Before Removal:**
- [ ] Test smart system in production environment
- [ ] Confirm all ESP32 integrations work with new endpoints
- [ ] Train staff on new interface
- [ ] Verify all tablet devices work with new UI
- [ ] Backup legacy system files

## ðŸŽ¯ BENEFITS OF NEW SYSTEM

### **User Experience**
- **Professional appearance** suitable for luxury resort
- **Intuitive interface** with modern design patterns
- **Consistent branding** throughout the system
- **Better mobile/tablet experience**

### **Technical Improvements**

- `/iot/smart/{room}/` â†’ Smart Room Control
- `/iot/smart/{room}/config/` â†’ Smart Room Configuration

### **Legacy URLs (Backup):**
- `/iot/legacy/` â†’ Legacy Room Access
- `/iot/room/{room}/` â†’ Legacy Room Control
- `/iot/room/{room}/config/` â†’ Legacy ESP32 Configuration

### **API Endpoints (Unchanged):**
